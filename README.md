## Calculation of Iteration 1's Velocity and applied to I2's Planning for MS2   
### Explanation for Iteration/BurnDown Chart Ambiguity:   
We encountered an Android Studio issue that had not been fixed during Iteration1, even with the assistance of multiple tutors and TAs.   
This issue delayed our start date for Iteration 1.   
When we reached out to the TA, our team was instructed to post a private Piazza post to the instructors to be recalled upon grading as explanation/context.   
The Professor explained that we should close  two stories and roll everything else over to Iteration 2.   
This explains why we only have 16 hours of work in Iteration 1 and 67 hours of work in Iteration 2.  
### Iteration 1:  
3/1 to 3/6: 7 days  
Estimate working hours: 16hrs   
People: 6  
Working hours per day: 2 hrs  
V1 = (Estimate working hour) / (Working Hour) = 16 hrs / (7 days * 6 people * 2 hrs/day) = 0.190  
### Iteration 2:  
3/7 to 3/14: 8 days  
Estimate working hours: 67hrs  
People: 6  
Working hours per day: 3 hrs  
V2 = (Estimate working hour) / (Working Hour) = 67 hrs / (8 days * 6 people * 3 hrs/day) = 0.465  
### MS2 Velocity Result  
V total = (16+67) /( 84+144 ) = 0.364
