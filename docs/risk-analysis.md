## Risk Analysis 1
Risk: Team Member Unavailability
Description: There is a risk that some team members may be unavailable attending meetings or working on tasks due to unexpected circumstances (sick, time conflict…), which may lead to miscommunication and impact the progress and the overall timeline of the project. 
Severity: High
Resolution: We use slack to communicate and share the most recent updates on the project to keep everyone on the same page and reasonably assign tasks to each iteration to ensure progress.   
Status: Resolved

## Risk Analysis 2
Risk: Inaccurate Voice Recognition Using the Mic
Description: There is a risk that the mic feature falsely recognizes the user’s input, leading to the addition of incorrect goals to the app. 
Severity: High
Resolution: We can conduct accuracy testing with different voices and update the feature based on user feedback. 
Status: In progress

## Risk Analysis 3
Risk: Incorrect Ranking of the Goal List
Description: There is a risk that the ranking of the goal list is messed up in the scenario where users add and cross out goals frequently, leading to false placement of the prioritized goals. 
Severity: Medium
Resolution: We can clearly implement the logic for ranking goals and perform testing of different scenarios to ensure its functionality. 
Status: In progress

## Risk Analysis 4
Risk: Lack of experience with Android APIs and Database Implementation
Description: There is a risk that the team has limited familiarity with Android APIs, which may lead to challenges in implementing certain features and functionalities of the app, for example the mic feature that requires translating voice to text and the need to persistently store events in app even when it is closed. 
Severity: Medium
Resolution: We can conduct research on specific Android APIs that are relevant to the features of our apps and learn how to implement databases that satisfy our requirements for persistent data storage. 
Status: In progress

## Risk Analysis 5
Risk: UI Design Challenges 
Description: There is a risk that the team may face difficulties in creating the user interface such as issues related to design and navigation. 
Severity: Medium
Resolution: We can focus on keeping the design of the app simple and easy to use and conduct usability testing and incorporate the feedback for improvements.  
Status: In progress
