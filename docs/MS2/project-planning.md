MS2  
Planning [out of 100%]  
MS 1 Postmortem analysis [10%]  
Record (a) what worked or went well in MS 1, and (b) what didn't.  
Risks: adjusted, ranked, and classified high, medium, low, with a solution plan for each (see Risk Analysis resource)  
These should at least address "what didn't" above, as your project is at risk of having them recur in MS 2.  The solution plan includes tweaks to your Agile process to ensure "what didn't" doesn't happen again.  
Calculation of Velocity with justification based on MS 1 results  

User Stories (in BDD style, named, estimated, prioritized, with wire-framed UI screens, as necessary) [40%]  
Tasks for the Stories in your first Iteration (assigned to Stories as appropriate, and estimated) [20%]
