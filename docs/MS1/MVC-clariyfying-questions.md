General Intro:
"Hello MVC, hope the weekend treated you well. We have a few clarifying questions: "

#1)
Given : "Jessica makes sure that Successorator is the displayed app each time she sleeps her phone."
Does this mean there is a full background image showing a screenshot of the app and MIT's, a widget 
on the sleep screen with same info, or a notification banner with only the one MIT showing?

#2)
The app's primary goal is to prioritize events in the order they are input, meaning 1st item entered is the MIT 
and all subsequent entries are thus not as important until the top item is completed, at which point the priority
changes to the next item. Is this is sufficient without adding time deadlines in the app?
